Lesson 00 Notes:

Mutability must be explicitly declared

Default types for numeric literals: i32 and f64

Slices are array "subviews"

String Interpolation Operators: 
	Basic: {}
	e.g. println!("{}",5);
	
	Hex: {:x}
	
	Debug: {:?}
	e.g. println!("{:?}", [1, 2, 3]);
	Note: some types, such as arrays and Vecs can only be printed via debug
	
Unit (nothing) in Rust is type () with value ()
	It is the return type and value of expressions ending in semi-colon
	i.e. omit semicolon, and expression's evaluated value is returned
	can't omit semicolon in variable binding statements (let)

All arms of if-statements must have same type.

Function references can be used to rename functions, or as arguments for other functions.
	e.g. apply_twice  f(f(x))
	See slide 44	
	
Match is a switch-statement on steroids!
	See slide 52 and 53

Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use.
