Lesson 02 Notes

Mutability is a property of the variable binding, not the type.

Structs and enums have their methods (functions) implemented in impl block
	The first argument for each of these functions is "self"
	e.g. &self, &mut self, or self
	i.e. Methods are a special case of function in Rust because of the self argument, which doesn't have a declared type

Use if-let to rewrite one-arm match statements (does pattern matching and binding in one statement)
	Use while-let if need to do the same, but with loop
	
Use @ for inner-bindings

Any struct or enum that contains a reference must have an explicit lifetime. (e.g. 'a)

###Internals of an enum are public
